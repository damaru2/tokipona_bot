sina sona ala e toki Inli la o kepeken e ni: /sona

You can write in [sitelen pona](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/hieroglyphs.php) in many fonts. Write the bot name in a chat, then some words and finish the sentence with a slash (i.e. / ). Example:

`@tokipona_bot ni li pona mute tawa mi /`

After writing the slash an image will appear in a moment and then you can click/tap it to send it.

With Linja Pona, you can write compound words (noun + adjective) by concatenating the words. Not all combinations are available. Example:

`@tokipona_bot tokipona li pona tawa mi /`

You can draw a rectangle for names by surrounding several words by \[ ]. You can also write a capitalized valid Toki Pona name in order to get symbols that spell that word. Example:

`@tokipona_bot ma [kasi alasa nasin awen telo a] li suli / `
`@tokipona_bot ma [Kanata] li suli / `

Change the font and colors using /wilemi. Only the default font (Linja Pona - jan Same) is complete. Others may not let you write some words (like kin), or may not have Latin characters. [Code on Github](https://github.com/damaru2/tokipona_bot/)
